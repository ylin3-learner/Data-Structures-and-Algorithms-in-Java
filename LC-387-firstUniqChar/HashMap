HashMap - Transfer "key" into "index". [空間換時間] {O(n) [space] : O(1) [time]}

1. Hash Function : Turn every different key into a unique index.

Problem -> Hash Collision : Not every key can be easily turned into a unique index.

- Properties:
1. Uniformity: if (a == b) hash(a) == hash(b)
2. Efficiency: Compute easily
3. Universality: hash value distributes balanced.

2. Operation in HashMap.
